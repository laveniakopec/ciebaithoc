So here's the thing, my friend runs a fun course and asked her students to basically uncover some secret information in a txt file on notepad she made and posted on the internet. She challenged me to find out information (im like 101 forensic stuff) from the text. So anyways i open up the text in HxD and it doesn't have a file signature or magic numbers for me to rely on, and it also doesn't really make much sense in any other way to me either. Basically all of the corresponding

Not sure, but I shall proceed (: I've got MS-DOS ARJ archiver ver 2.50 executable that was used to encode a file (`arj a -g? archive.arj somefile.txt`) and the file in question. After some hex digging with my own sample files I've gathered that it's definitely XOR, with each byte `b ^= (b+value)`. Said value seems to be changing every 4 or so bytes. I have a guess that it's derived from password somehow, but that needs checking.

Hey everyone, I just bought few ATtiny25V-10SU MCUs for a small project and the code tested before on ATtiny85-10SU doesn't work properly.

I am a beginner level malware analyst/reverse-engineer, senior software developer, certified forensic investigator.

I've been playing back through the Borderlands series with some of my friends in preparation for the third game coming out, and we've been using the community patch for BL2 with no issues. We've done all the hex editing to get it to work, everything is set up correctly after the update. We're currently going through the DLC campaigns for BL2 on UVH and after we finish these, we're moving to the pre-sequel. TPS' community patch, however, seems to be. broken. I don't mean it won't load, I don't. morgue ( I know, not a very high scoring run, but this was the first 'caster' win. I decided to wear medium armor and eventually went for a stabby playstyle and blasted/hit things that I couldn't. It was really stabbing an OOF. I don't think anything tops that. I was worried about split training, but as a Skald I relied on low level charms like regen, shroud, and the hex confusing touch to handle anything Hi everyone, amp#x200B; Below is an overview of the series of fortunate events that led to the confirmation that the Original Trilogy Millennium Falcon will be coming to the game soon. A better, more concise version is going to be put on the events teasers wiki ( https://wiki.swgoh.help/wiki/Event\_Teasers (https://wiki.swgoh.help/wiki/Event_Teasers)) but I thought I'd give a rundown of the 24 hours or so. I was unfortunately travelling and sleeping when the previous other teasers To preface this, I did all the hex stuff after update (using corret version of Multitool) and console is apparently working as intended. amp#x200B; However, even after I "exec Patch.txt", the changes simply do not apply at all ingame (auto eridium pickup being the first one that comes to mind, but others also are not working at all after testing). amp#x200B; Did I do something wrong? Anyone has any idea on how to fix this? amp#x200B; Edit: I did the exact same thing To begin with a description of what happened, I used the windows 10 .iso, or whatever the boot utility is called on the disk. I didn't expect it to serrate out a 30 gig partition and screw all other data. I am not sure if it was formatted, or what exactly happened. I am not sure if I could somehow adjust the w10 start up partion in such a way as to restore the data. If that is possible my question changes to that, or rather encompasses it. amp#x200B; Secondly, I used recoverit Hello I have downloaded the new engine.upk from modsnexus and have copy pasted it to the directory in the instructions (C:\Program Files (x86)\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole) however when I start up the game I do not have the new UI that's supposed to happen when starting it up and the backslash button doesn't open up the console in game. Edit: I found a work around I put DESCRIPTION=Enables Console and Developer's Shell for XCOM Enemy Within. I've made a script to download your whole library. You just need to have ruby installed and `curl` in your path. Just follow the instructions. Does not support 2FA (probably, did not try).

Me and my friends are playing the pre sequel through again after getting revitalized by seeing the borderlands 3 announcement. I saw that there was an unofficial community patch and figured that would be a great addition to our playthrough. So I go through all the googling steps, patch.txt in binaries, BLCMM downloaded, everything looks good. I get in game use my tilde key type exec Patch.txt and instead of executing it merely does "say exec Patch.txt" I go in and check the settings.

I'm sure this is a common issue here on the sub but I'm having trouble loading the bl2reborn mod into the game. First I use the hex multitool and click 'yes' to applying the console patch, and apply it with these settings. https://i.gyazo.com/0c3d98b476c4c46082aa13fa756fa77f.png (https://i.gyazo.com/0c3d98b476c4c46082aa13fa756fa77f.png) Next I open BLCMM and go to the 'setup game files for mods' tab and my window looks like this. I change nothing and click ok https://i.gyazo.com/87d2040eeb. Right now I am trying to play a bl2 reborn playthrough, but every time I try to exec the mod, it says "(my username) says 'exec BL2Reborn.txt'" I went to make sure that it was hex edited and it said that there is an unknown error with my hex editing. How can I fix this? amp#x200B. Hi. I am trying the BL2 Reborn mod pack for the first time and i have heard that there are problems with it after the patch. I have used the updated hex multitool to patch my game, but when i try to exectute the mod txt in game, it gives me a bunch of "unrecognized class or object" errors. Although i get the mods message and greeting, i am confused as to does it actually work when i get theese errors or does it mean that i have failed the installation? How do i avoid that? https://imgur.com. I spent over 5 hours messing around with the controlmapvr.txt to try and switch the joysticks around, but it seemed impossible to get 'Jump or Sneak' unbound from the left stick and working nicely with 'Look' on the right stick. After much frustration I decided to see if I could rebind the keys in SteamVR and apparently you can bind them per application. If I had realized this I would not have wasted the last 2 nights trying to figure out hex and binary flags. So I am here to spread I followed guides to enable full console commands in my game using Hex Workshop. The game starts fine, and I'm able to use the console command successfully using my tilde key. But when I type "exec patch.txt" it will not activate. Instead, I'm getting a text message of "say." from the in-game chat. Research tells me that means the patch is not running. I've ensured that the patch is in the correct binaries folder. I found people with the same problem in google.but no answers I've got some code which reads lines from a txt file and then does adds to a database.
