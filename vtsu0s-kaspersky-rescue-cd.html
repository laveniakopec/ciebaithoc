They work fine when in the recovery screen, live cds, bios, any place but win 10. external keyboards and mice cant be read either. in the Device manager the warning triangles are next to the devices. Also I cant start programs even with the touch screen so I thought it might be a virus so I used kaspersky rescue Kaspersky Rescue Disk - эффективное средство для проверки и лечения зараженных компьютеров, когда стандартными способами вылечить его невозможно. 
So, I'm working on a clients machine they brought in for some virus removal. I've ran MWB, Vipre Rescue, Hitman, ADW, JRT, RK, Vipre, Kaspersky Rescue CD and Combofix against this machine. I got 99% of everything. The only thing I can't get rid of are these damned pop-ups. I've already deleted all the browser stuff under Local/Roaming and removed/reinstalled the browsers from scratch w/o importing anything. Nothing odd running under msconfig or active processes under Process Explorer. I'm stump. 360 Total Security - надежный и быстро набирающий популярность антивирус.

It can't even connect to LAN addresses like 192.168.1.1. Meanwhile, every other program (e.g. Spotify) and browser (e.g. Chrome) on the computer connects to the Internet just fine. If I uninstall the IE10 update and revert back to IE9, then Internet Explorer works again. So I suppose that's a "fix". This is a connectivity problem with IE10 and only IE10. Here are some things I tried. VLC Media Player - Представляет собой мощный медиацентр-проигрыватель все в одном. Одной из особенностей является возможность проигрывания практически любого типа потокового видео. We manage a fair amount of desktop computers remotely and viruses can always be a challenge. Often times virus removal requires a tech on-site to run an offline scan like Windows Defender Offline, Kaspersky Rescue CD, etc. I'm interested in installing one of those rescue CDs as a partition image with dual boot via Grub (or something similar) that an end user could easily kick off, or that we could script during the shutdown/reboot process of Windows itself. The trick would be that it would. Описание. Думаю, у всех нас есть несколько любимых cd/dvd с операционными системами, программами, утилитами для восстановления и проверки ОС и оборудования и пр. пр., которые мы постоянно носим. 
I have a problem with my pc. From some days It often doesn't go on internet and it's very slowly. In the task manager in performance tab often there is CPU or Disc or Ethernet that has 99% of usage for no reason. I did a complete Pc scan with Windows defender, 9 lab removal tool, Super anti-spyware and Kaspersky rescue cd ; they found some trojan but no one resolved the problem. Someone could help me please? :) Pc specs: Windows 8 64 bit, 4 gb RAM, CPU intel core 2 Quad Q6600. В интернете есть много программ (в том числе пиратских) и сборок Windows с припиской SamLab.ws - не верьте этому. My Mother lives out of town and she's having a bit of trouble with some pop-ups (Win7, Intel i5 Sandybridge 2400 or something, 4gb ram) I'm not that good with remote assistance so I thought I would try to find out some user friendly software to help her clean up her PC.

I have a 1GB pen drive I would like to install Puppy on with ClamAV and ClamTK installed and keep it updated to scan computers. My issue is I can make the LiveUSB's but I haven't been able to keep downloaded software on it. Is there a way I can make a portable Linux with customized and updated definitions, etc. without having to install software all the time (issues with not having internet everywhere, and having FUPs at home really limits the times I want to download software on a LiveUSB).

PLEASE HELP Sony VAIO Laptop on Windows 7, there aren't any updates available. I have a virus, it is disabling reg-edit and taskmanager i have ran MBAM scans that have detected it multiple times but upon reboot it seems to be re-infected i have tried scanning with mbam in safemode, aswell as combofox , tdsskiller and adwclaner Edit more info : here are the files and processes detected as well as the malicious registry edits created. Edit: after full removal in safemode and reboot to safemode to verify i was able to upload this sample to virus. So my mom's computer has a virus on it. Every time I run a program in normal mode it has a pop up, and even when I goto DOS and use C: prompt it won't activate the program(program being rstrui.exe in this case, or system restore). The virus protection program we had(trend micro) stopped working a week or so ago and that's how I think something went wrong. Any help or being pointed in the right direction would be great. 
 I see a lot of sales for USB flash drives and I often post my own configuration for a "rescue kit" that works around a versatile, multi-boot system. Below is information gathered from my past posts on the subject. ## Tool/OS Selection One use for flash drives is as an emergency rescue kit suitable for any situation. While you can get away with a 32GB drive for this, I prefer at least 64GB. One of a larger size (256GB) can have those capabilities while still leaving sufficient space Hi, I just came back home after being away for 4 months, only to find out my machine has been infected for at least 2 months. I suspect my little cousin gained access somehow and downloaded sketchy games that executed the malicious code. I've already taken several precaution measures: 1) Disconnected the machine from the LAN 2) Disconnected all Windows 10 machines from the LAN 3) Firmware reset both router and modem 4) Used Kaspersky Rescue Disk to find and kill the ransomware Trying to free up space on my NAS, I realized I have a LOT of old live-CD/DVD iso files. I've gotten rid of most of my old PCs in the past few years. Is there any value in holding on to older versions of Ubuntu, Mint, Knoppix, Fedora? Utility CDs like SystemRescue, Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Clonezilla? Or even the small stuff like Puppy, DSL, Feather. Preface: There is this guy - let's call him Pete. Pete comes in the IT Department every month or so, because his Computer fails somehow  Actually, Petes Computer doesn't fail on it's own - Pete just doesn't know how to properly watch porn on the internet. Today: Porn Pete (how we call him) comes in to our IT department and rages about that something happend again on the internet and that we just need to run the CD again (Kaspersky Rescue Boot Disk). My colleague starts his Comput. I wrote up this other list ( of ISO's for /r/homelab. I figure we could use a similar thread here for tech related ISO's. Let's get it rockin' shall we? I will assume 64bit, x86, and global download mirror site lists when possible. Note that I may duplicate in some areas if they fit both categories, trying to keep this at a minimum though. Antivirus: AVG RESCUE CD ( Avira AntiVir Rescue I've been looking into setting up my arsenal of Flash Drives and I was wondering on what you people have. Here's my current layout Flash Drive Size Currently Installed --------- ---------- ---------- 4GB Kaspersky Rescue Disk 32GB Avast, CCleaner, HWMonitor, Malwarebytes 8GB Ubuntu 14.04 LiveCD I'm interested on what you people As a service to my coworkers,. I've decided to build and maintain a collection of bootable utility CDs. (see list below). We already build/maintain a customized WinPE CD that we mainly use for imaging, but I thought having a few more couldn't hurt. Am I missing anything important ?

(This is more of a compilation of some tales of my beginning in computers than a big tale, but I hope you guys enjoy.) When I was very little, I got my first computer all to myself. My dad and grandad were (and still are) very much into computers at the time, having ran their own BBS system and all. My dad even helped port BBS Express ST to the Atari ST, I believe. Anyway, I got my first computer to play some games and stuff (mostly Putt Putt and Rainbow Six 3 through Comcast Games on Demand. Recently while surfing porn I have seen a warning message pop up that says something along the lines that the FBI is monitoring me and I need to pay a fine. It shows a popup asking for a code that you need to pay to get. It's poorly worded with misspellings and bad grammar, so obviously it is a scam. That's not my question. I Googled the message and there was only one result that said it was a virus. I scanned my computer with offline rescue CD's from Comodo and then Kaspersky. Comodo found. I haven't made any recent changes, other than the regular updates a few days ago, but I shut my PC down 2 nights ago with everything working fine and the next morning it wouldn't boot Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key_ When trying to repair with the Win install disk it gives me a compatability error claiming wrong version of System Recovery for this version of windows. If I force Ok. so here's the TL;DR DELL Latitude D620 running XP sp3,. User seems to have caught one of the "Security Center 2012" type trojans that hides all icons on desktop and infects the MBR. So here's what I've done so far: Pulled the drive out,. hook it into a USB enclosure and ran TDSSKiller on it. TDSSKiller identifies a infection in the MBR and says it successfully cleaned it. While I had the drive hooked up USB. I copied a fresh new version of ComboFix to the Users \Desktop. I was browsing the /r/techsupport's FAQ and came across this ( and thought I'd do as it said and make an "Incident Response USB Stick". My question is regarding "bootable Scanning amp Repair CDs". Of those, I noted that Kaspersky Rescue Disc was a iso. Is it possible and how would I go about making these programs/utilities/ insert proper jargon bootable from the usb or should I go ahead Нажмите на клавишу Esc, когда на экране появится сообщение с текстом Press ESC to load Kaspersky Rescue.
