Add a new aura to the loyalty store that mimics the mahj aura under a new name. BOOM! All players now have access to a +5% damage aura. everyone's happy. right?

(Scenario B - separate cooldowns) premier club members retain a special perk having double use of +5% damage Let's set aside loyalty point issues  Hi guys, it's sh1nj1! It has been a while. ampnbsp; As you all know, there is an club event which can be played at least once a month in HQ: DPM. As our translators translated it in the Line Group, it will be known as a "Fierce Fighting Club Event" or just "Club Event" for short. ampnbsp; As you know, this event allows you to join any selected team that has been introduced in Haikyuu DPM thus far. This event allows you and your team members to defeat the opposing event club character. r/longrange, I want to start competing in long range, and I want to shoot with the AR platform. I've narrowed down my rifle choices between two cartridges: 6.5CM and 300WM. This rifles only use would be competition, so a heavy rifle isn't an issue. I've researched both as much as possible through the magic of the internet, but I would appreciate the collective wisdom of this community. Now I know that I can build a 6.5CM w/optic for less than the NemoArms rifle, but NemoArms states Stalingrad is perhaps the most controversial cruisers to date. Some players think its overpowered and others think it sucks. And to be honest, how one sees this ship is fully dependent on the viewpoint, I can understand both sides, as I will explain below: ampnbsp; For Random Battles ampnbsp; From the view of an average player, this ship is overpowered. Its simple to see why as its a "cruiser" with a massive hp advantage, a massive armor advantage, but most importantly 
Introduction Finally, I have gotten around to writing this one. I sort of delayed it constantly as I kept sitting down to work on it but got caught up in reading. I generally liked reading about it, but I just got lost in the text. Well, I was going to do it eventually but I just wanted to make sure it was up before any official announcement of the line. #Tier X: XXX (1950) Historical Design: Project 24 - Scheme XIII Historical References: Superlinkory of Stalin - Sovets. ~~Finally finished up piecing together my first 308 AR and brought it to the range to test fire it. Just to break the barrel in I ran through roughly 100 rounds of Federal Power-Shock 150 grain, and to my surprise everything ran perfect. Rifle was cycling smooth, brass was getting thrown, and although it wasn't quite that accurate yet rounds were going downrange and striking paper. After going through the last of the less expensive ammunition I started loading up some Federal Sierra 175 grain. I recently talked to my pre-health advisor about my path to medical school and she said she doesn't recommend me to pursue that career anymore. I am a 19 year old who recently started junior year in college majoring in Biology. Unfortunately I did not do so well my sophomore year, largely due to preoccupation of family health related issues. My GPA before my sophomore year was a 3.67 but now its a 3.55. I am involved in nonclinical volunteering, ER volunteering, Research (getting published soon).

IT HAS BEEN A NICE 2YRS DONPISHA! THANK YOU. As most of the regular players might have realised, Haikyuu: Donpisha Match was speculated to be terminated after the game not really celebrating its 2nd year Anniversary this year. Well, that news have finally come to be. ampnbsp; After the recent update, Haikyuu Donpisha Match will end its services on the 6th November, 2018  ampnbsp; #Here is what is going. I have a few questions- I'm new to the sport and would like to start preparing for my first match. I own the following: SampW MP 40. Panther Arms DPMS Oracle, 18.5". Maverick 88, 18" 12 gauge (Mossberg 500). I see a lot nicer, longer barrel shotguns being used. Will mine work fine? Should I grab a longer barrel and mag tube extension for it? My DPMS only has iron sights, stock trigger. I really don't want to invest much since I don't know after the first match if I really want to pursue. grinded the Porsche line today just to get the 30.01 (p) and holy hell is this a good tank. it was probably a decent tank before 9.17.1 but that patch made this a monster. probably tied with the t-34-85m for the spot of best tier 6 medium. it's not really that fun to play compared to the type 64 and other meds, but the vk's combination of raw firepower and hulldown stopping power is unrivaled at tier 6 -best in class 220 alpha and sacrifices pretty much no gun handling, peneration 
Is it to reach/maintain a certain win percentage record? Is it to (eventually) unlock and collect all tier X tanks? Is it to sit in one tank and seal club newbs every game? Or something else? For me I really want to have a good collection of tier X's (I.e. a reliable flanking medium, a sturdy heavy, a one shotting TD, a high dpm tank etc.) so I can enjoy the end game from all the different playstyles. Winrrate to me is just a measurement of how efficient my climb to tier X is and doesn'. Hello there, fellow redditors. As always the condensed version of the latest QnA. If you have any suggestions for improving this, let me know. Q: (https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfWarships/comments/7m0lrm/wows_qa_18/drqh9ip/) Is there any plan to complete akizuki line to T10 in 2018? A: We are looking at the ship projects to finish the line, but this is far from the easiest line in historical sense, so it might take considerable time. Therefore we can’t quite confirm Hi guys, it's sh1nj1! I guess it is time to actually finally put up a FAQ given the influx of new players via the Line group.

The title. Pretty much, if you use Reinforced club and going to twohand it you should go to Chaos+5 and Normal+15. Lightning+5 is always worse. Specifically, for Artorias, Manus and Kalameet Normal+15 does the most damage among all other paths (even without pine resin the damage difference is 10% and bigger). This is because of the 75% STR scaling on the club, 12 str stat of the Pyromancer and two hand grip, which effectively increases str by 50% and gives the R.Club ~~ Pittcairn-Monroeville Sportmens Club ( PMSC ( is hosting a PAFOA (pronounced POOFA apparently) shooting day on Saturday April 22, 2017 .

Recently we profiled the biggest free agents (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6kbjzu/free_agent_preview_master_list/?st=j4j6siprampsh=abee8838) with some detail, devoting a full post to each of them and their best potential fits. However, I wanted to give a shoutout to some players that I believe will be underpaid free agents. These are all players who played less than 26 minutes per game last season, but could go on to be solid rotational players for a club next year. (5) SF Justin. LightUp Shopping Club Inc.
